# Algorithmia + Twitter 

One of the most compelling use cases of sentiment analysis today is brand awareness. If you can understand what people are saying about you in a natural context, you can work towards addressing key problems and improving your business processes. So how exactly can you get that up and running?

The Algorithmia marketplace makes it easy to extract the content you need from Twitter and pipe it into the right algorithms for sentiment analysis. There are a few algorithms on the platform for exploring different information from Twitter (like users, tweets, and followers), and a number for sentiment analysis.
