[Algorithmia](https://algorithmia.com) lets you add the power of serverless machine-learning and utility microservices to almost any other service / application. A wide variety of [algorithms](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/) algorithms are available, and can be called via POST or from various [language clients](https://algorithmia.com/developers/clients/).

For one example, see [RunDexter](https://github.com/algorithmiaio/integrations/tree/master/RunDexter). Due to the nature of Dexter's bots, this sample is a set of cut-and-paste code templates. However, other solutions might include full-featured plugins, app project files, or even machine instances.

If you don't yet have an Algorithmia account, [sign up](https://algorithmia.com/signup/) with the promo code `Hacktoberfest` for $50 in free credits.

Then, select any third-party service you find interesting, and add whatever form of integration you feel would be most useful. We'll feature the best ones on our [blog](http://blog.algorithmia.com)!

Thanks for your help!
